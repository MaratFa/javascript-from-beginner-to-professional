/*  
Using string manipulation, create a function that will return a string with the first
letter of all the words capitalized and the rest of the letters in lowercase. You should
transform the sentence thIs will be capiTalized for each word into This Will Be
Capitalized For Each Word:
*/

/* 1. Create a string with several words that have letters with different cases, a
mix of upper and lowercase words: */

/* 2. Create a function that gets a string as an argument, which will be the value
that we will manipulate: */

// 3. In the function first transform everything to lowercase letters:

/* 4. Create an empty array that can hold the values of the words when we
capitalize them: */

// 5. Convert the phrase into words in an array using the split() method:

/* 6. Loop through each one of the words that are now in the new array, so you
can select each one independently. You can use forEach() for this: */

/* 7. Using slice() isolate the first letter in each word, then transform it to
uppercase. Again using slice(), get the remaining value of the word
without including the first letter. Then concatenate the two together to form
the word that is now capitalized: */

/* 8. Add the new capitalized word into the blank array that you created. By the
end of the loop you should have an array with all the words as separate
items in the new array: */

/* 9. Take the array of updated words and using the join() method, transform
them back into a string with spaces between each word: */

/* 10. Return the value of the newly updated string with capitalized words that can
then be output into the console: */
